# Exploit Number 1 - LFD:
uc-httpd is vulnerable to local file disclosure through means of sending a single HTTP GET request to the affected server. It is also vulnerable to an attack vector that (we believe) has no name. In the past when coming across this vector, we've referred to it as "dynamic directory/path traversal" (if you can think of a more fitting name, let us know!) - this vulnerability alone can be used to achieve full device compromise. This can be achieved either reading /etc/passwd (which symlinks from shadow file - also no SHA encryption) or if some reason you can't get SSH access or the root password is invalid, then alternatively you can read `/mnt/mtd/Config/Account1` which will give you the admin user/pass for the web panel (found on port 80) - If neither of the above methods are working, then instead this vulnerability can be used to bypass ASLR via reading procfiles and utilizing the seperate Buffer Overflow in order to gain access that way.

# Exploit Number 2 - Buffer Overflow:
uc-httpd's web portal is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Although ASLR is in place, it is extremely trivial to bypass this provided that you have access to the first vulnerability. This can be achieved by sifting through /proc entries in order to snag the relevant memory address. Without the first vulnerability, another method would be required to bypass ASLR. This technique is only necessary if for some reason the method listed above fails.
